# COSC-4351-Project
Description: 
You have been asked to build an admin portal that will allow your company internal employees to access the portal and perform admin functions on behalf of company clients.

Here are additional details:

    •	Admin portal is accessible only on company network to only company employees that have one of the "ADMIN" roles. 

    •	Access to the links is role based i.e. only authenticated internal employees with "ADMIN" role are able to access the portal and what links you can access once on the portal is determined based on what other roles you have. So, same link will not be visible to another admin who doesn't have appropriate role to access the link.

    •	The links redirect users to the admin application that is not developed by you. You are only providing links to the portal and redirect users to appropriate application.

    •	There are five categories of applications and five admin roles for each category. Here are the details:
